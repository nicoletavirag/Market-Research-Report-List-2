<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Black pellets, also known as advanced bio-coal, are a type of renewable energy source that has been processed to have a higher energy density and better combustion characteristics compared to traditional wood pellets. Torrefaction is a method where biomass is heated in the absence of oxygen to remove moisture and volatile organic compounds, resulting in a blackened, energy-dense pellet. Steam explosion, on the other hand, involves treating biomass with high-pressure steam to break down its structure and create a more homogenous and denser pellet. Both methods aim to produce a high-quality biofuel for energy generation.</p></p>
