<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Melting Point Polypropylene Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>20-30 g/10 min</li><li>30.1-35 g/10 min</li><li>35.1-100 g/10 min</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Melting Point Polypropylene Fiber is categorized based on its melt flow rate, which is measured in grams per 10 minutes (g/10 min). The types are: -20-30 g/10 min, 30.1-35 g/10 min, and 35.1-100 g/10 min. The lower the melt flow rate, the higher the viscosity and strength of the fiber. Fibers with a melt flow rate of -20-30 g/10 min are ideal for applications requiring high strength and durability. On the other hand, fibers with a melt flow rate of 35.1-100 g/10 min are more flexible and suitable for applications where flexibility is important.</p></p>
