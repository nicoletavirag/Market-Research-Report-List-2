<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microwave Coupler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coupled Transmission Line</li><li>Independent Transmission Line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microwave couplers are categorized into two main types: coupled transmission line and independent transmission line couplers. Coupled transmission line couplers allow for the transfer of microwave signals between two closely spaced transmission lines, while independent transmission line couplers function by splitting or combining microwave signals from separate, independent transmission lines. Coupled transmission line couplers are commonly used in applications where precise control over signal coupling is required, while independent transmission line couplers are preferred for applications that necessitate isolating or combining signals from separate paths.</p></p>
