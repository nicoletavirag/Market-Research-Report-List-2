<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Modulating Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Butterfly Valve</li><li>Ball Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure modulating valves are categorized into two main types - butterfly valves and ball valves. Butterfly valves are characterized by a disc which rotates on a shaft to control flow, while ball valves use a spherical closure unit to regulate flow. Both valves are commonly used in industries such as oil and gas, water treatment, and HVAC systems to regulate pressure and flow of liquids or gases. The choice between butterfly and ball valves depends on factors such as pressure rating, size, material compatibility, and cost.</p></p>
