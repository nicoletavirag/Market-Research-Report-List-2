<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillators for Public Access Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semi-automated defibrillators require the user to push a button to deliver a shock to the patient after analyzing the heart rhythm. These are typically used in public places where trained personnel may be available to assist in the resuscitation process. Fully automated defibrillators, on the other hand, require no user intervention and deliver a shock automatically after analyzing the heart rhythm. These are commonly used in public access settings where there may be limited or no trained personnel present to assist in a cardiac emergency.</p></p>
