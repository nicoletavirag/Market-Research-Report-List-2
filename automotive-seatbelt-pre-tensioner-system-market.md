<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seatbelt Pre-tensioner System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-tightening</li><li>Pre-roll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive seatbelt pre-tensioner systems come in two types: pre-tightening and pre-roll. Pre-tightening systems activate during a collision by pulling the seatbelt tight against the occupant, reducing forward movement and impact. Pre-roll systems work by retracting the seatbelt slightly before a collision, ensuring that the occupant is securely positioned in their seat to optimize the effectiveness of the seatbelt during impact. Both systems aim to enhance occupant safety by minimizing movement and reducing the risk of injury in a crash.</p></p>
