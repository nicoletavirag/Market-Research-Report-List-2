<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biologic Hernia Repair Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Partially Absorbable Hernia Repair Mesh</li><li>Fully Absorbable Hernia Repair Mesh</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Partially absorbable hernia repair mesh is a type of biologic mesh that contains a combination of non-absorbable and absorbable materials. It provides initial support for tissue repair and gradually gets absorbed by the body over time. On the other hand, fully absorbable hernia repair mesh is made entirely of absorbable materials that are gradually broken down and metabolized by the body. Both types of mesh offer biologic alternatives to traditional synthetic mesh for hernia repair procedures.</p></p>
