<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Engineering Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Type</li><li>Thermoplastics Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive engineering plastics market includes two main types - thermosetting type and thermoplastics type. Thermosetting plastics, once heated and molded, cannot be re-melted or re-shaped. They provide better resistance to high temperatures and chemical exposure, making them suitable for automotive engine components. On the other hand, thermoplastics can be re-melted and reshaped, making them more versatile for various automotive interior and exterior components. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing the performance, durability, and aesthetics of modern vehicles.</p></p>
