<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Cryolite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder (80-325mesh)</li><li>Granular (0-10mm)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic Cryolite is available in two main types: Powder (80-325mesh) and Granular (0-10mm). The Powder type has a finer texture, with particles ranging from 80 to 325 mesh in size, making it suitable for applications requiring a fine, uniform coating. On the other hand, the Granular type consists of larger particles, measuring between 0 to 10mm in size, which are preferred for uses where a more granular texture is desired. Both types offer specific advantages depending on the intended application.</p></p>
