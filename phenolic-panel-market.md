<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phenolic Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Panel</li><li>Ordinary Panel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phenolic panels can be divided into two main market types: sandwich panels and ordinary panels. Sandwich panels consist of two outer layers with a lightweight core material in between, providing strong insulation properties. They are commonly used in construction for their durability and energy efficiency. Ordinary panels, on the other hand, are single-layered and typically used for interior applications such as wall cladding. Both types of phenolic panels offer fire resistance, moisture resistance, and easy installation, making them popular choices in the construction industry.</p></p>
