<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indium Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Indium</li><li>Secondary Indium</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Primary Indium refers to virgin or newly mined indium that is directly extracted from the earth's crust. It is considered pure and has not been previously used or recycled. Secondary Indium, on the other hand, is indium that has been previously used in products or processes and then recycled for reuse. This type of indium is obtained from scrap materials or waste products, undergoing a process of purification before being reintroduced into the market. Both Primary and Secondary Indium play a crucial role in meeting the global demand for this valuable material.</p></p>
