<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wankel Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wankel engines can be categorized into two main market types based on their cooling systems: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled Wankel engines use a liquid coolant to dissipate heat from the engine, allowing for more efficient cooling and better performance. On the other hand, air-cooled Wankel engines rely on airflow to cool the engine, making them simpler and lighter but potentially less effective in high-demand situations. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various applications based on specific needs.</p></p>
