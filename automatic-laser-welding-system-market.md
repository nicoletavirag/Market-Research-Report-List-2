<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Laser Welding System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Full-automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>An automatic laser welding system can be categorized into two main types - semi-automatic and full automatic. Semi-automatic systems require manual loading and unloading of the parts to be welded, while the welding process itself is automated. On the other hand, full-automatic systems are completely automated from loading to welding to unloading without any manual intervention. Semi-automatic systems are more cost-effective and versatile, while full automatic systems are faster and more efficient for high-volume production. Both types offer precision and accuracy in laser welding processes.</p></p>
