<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DMLS 3D Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coaxial Powder Feeding</li><li>Roller Powder Feeding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DMLS 3D printers come in different types based on their powder feeding mechanisms. Coaxial powder feeding systems use a nozzle to deliver the powder and a laser to melt it layer by layer. This ensures accurate and consistent printing. On the other hand, roller powder feeding systems use a roller to spread the powder evenly before the laser melts it. This method is efficient for high-volume production. Both market types cater to different manufacturing needs and offer unique advantages in the realm of 3D printing technology.</p></p>
