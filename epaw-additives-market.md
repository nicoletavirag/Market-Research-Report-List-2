<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EP/AW Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EP Additives</li><li>AW Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EP Additives (Extreme Pressure Additives) are used in lubricants to reduce friction and wear in metal-to-metal contact under high loads and speeds. They form a protective film on metal surfaces, preventing metal-to-metal contact and reducing wear. AW Additives (Anti-Wear Additives) are used to reduce friction and wear in lubricants by forming a protective film on metal surfaces. While EP additives are specifically designed for high-pressure conditions, AW additives are more general-purpose and provide protection under normal operating conditions.</p></p>
