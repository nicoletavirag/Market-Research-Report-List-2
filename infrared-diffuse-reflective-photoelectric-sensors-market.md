<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Diffuse Reflective Photoelectric Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital Signal</li><li>Analog Signal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared diffuse reflective photoelectric sensors are classified into two market types based on their signal output: digital signal and analog signal. Digital signal sensors provide a binary output, meaning they detect the presence or absence of an object without providing any additional information. On the other hand, analog signal sensors provide continuous output that varies depending on the proximity of the object. Both types of sensors are widely used in industrial automation, robotics, and other applications requiring object detection and distance measurement.</p></p>
