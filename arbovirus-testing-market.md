<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arbovirus Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibody Tests</li><li>Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arbovirus Testing market includes various types of tests such as Antibody Tests and Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing. Antibody Tests detect the presence of antibodies produced by the immune system in response to a specific arbovirus, indicating a past infection. Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing, on the other hand, identifies the genetic material of the virus itself, providing a more direct and sensitive method of detecting current infections. These tests play a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of arbovirus infections.</p></p>
